The site is a 9 km2 montane floodplain on the gravel- and cobble-bedded Middle Fork of the Flathead River, located in northwest Montana, USA. Meterological and soil data were collected from one location in the Nyack Floodplain of the Middle Fork of the Flathead River in Northwest Montana, USA from 2012 to 2019. The sensor array consisted of Vaisala PTB110 barometer to measure barometric pressure; Vaisala HMP45AC to measure air temperature and humidity; Texas Electronics Rain Gauge TE525WS to measure precipitation; RM Young Wind Monitor 12005 to measure wind speed and direction; Licor LI190R  Quantum Sensor to measure photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) flux density; a Licor LI200R Pyranometer to measure PAR flux density and total flux; a Campbell Scientific CS616 Water Content Reflectometer to measure volumetric water content; and a Campbell Scientific 107 Temperature Probe to measure soil temperature. Each sensor is connected to a CR1000 logger and wiring panel for data logging. A solar panel recharges a 7 Ahr battery with a 12 V regulator. This data is periodically sent via radio telemetry to a central receiving location at a research cabin from which data backhaul to Flathead Lake Biological Station is automatically conducted twice daily via a landline telephone. Sensors are serviced monthly. These data are raw and do have not been subject to any quality control or assurance.

Funding for the this data collection program came in part from a NSF Field Stations and Marine Labs (FSML) program award: Enhanced Cooperative Research and Education at Flathead Lake Biological Station and Taylor Wilderness Research Station (DBI-0934420; 2009-2012).
